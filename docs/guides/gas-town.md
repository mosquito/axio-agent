# Gas Town

This guide walks through the **Gas Town** example: a multi-agent convoy system
modelled on Steve Yegge's [Gas Town](https://github.com/gastownhall/gastown) methodology.

The full example lives in `examples/gas_town/` in the repository.
For a deep dive into the methodology itself, see {doc}`../gas-town-rules`.

## What is Gas Town?

Gas Town is an opinionated orchestration model with a few core ideas:

- **Beads** are the atomic unit of work — a SQLite-backed issue with id, title,
  status, assignee, and notes.
- **Convoys** are work orders: a named collection of beads representing one feature
  or task.
- **GUPP** (Gastown Universal Propulsion Principle): *if you find work assigned to
  you, you run it immediately* — no announcement, no waiting for approval.
- **Roles are fixed**: Mayor, Polecat, Witness, Refinery, Crew. Each has a strict
  contract. Polecats are ephemeral (one bead → done means gone); Crew are long-lived.

## Architecture

    PCn -->|closes bead N| DB
    W   -->|reads beads| DB
    R   -->|notes results| DB
    M   -->|tracks convoy| DB
```

The **Mayor** is the only agent the user interacts with. It decomposes the task
into beads, spawns polecats in parallel to work them, optionally spawns Witness for
health checks, and finally spawns Refinery to integrate the result.

## Project structure

The package has three Python modules: `__main__.py` (CLI and Rich renderer),
`beads.py` (SQLite bead store and `BeadTool`), and `swarm.py` (spawn tools,
`Analyze` tool, `build_toolbox()`, and `run_gastown()`). The `roles/` subdirectory
contains `__init__.py` (Mayor agent and role metadata) plus one TOML file per worker
role: polecat, witness, refinery, and crew.

## 1. Beads — the data plane

Beads are stored in `workspace/.gas-town/beads.db` (SQLite).
`run_gastown()` opens a single `aiosqlite.Connection` and passes it as tool context —
the same lifetime pattern as an `aiohttp.ClientSession`.

```python
async with aiosqlite.connect(db_path) as db:
    await db.execute(BEAD_DDL)
    await db.commit()
    toolbox = build_toolbox(workspace, on_event, transport, role_models, db)
    roles = load_agents(ROLES_DIR, toolbox=toolbox)
    ...
```

`BeadTool` is a `ToolHandler[aiosqlite.Connection]` — the open connection is its
typed context. It exposes five actions:

```python
class BeadTool(ToolHandler[aiosqlite.Connection]):
    """Manage the shared bead store (convoy issue tracker)."""

    action: Literal["list", "create", "update", "close", "note"]
    id: int = 0
    title: str = ""
    status: BStatus | None = None   # None preserves the current status
    assignee: str = ""
    notes: str = ""

    async def __call__(self, context: aiosqlite.Connection) -> str:
        db = context
        if self.action == "list":
            return await bead_summary(db)
        if self.action == "create":
            cur = await db.execute("INSERT INTO beads (title) VALUES (?)", (self.title,))
            await db.commit()
            return f"Created bead [{cur.lastrowid}]: {self.title}"
        ...
```

All worker agents get the same bead tool instance. Because the open connection is
a direct Python object (not looked up by path), concurrent polecats all write
through the same connection without any per-task lookup.

The `.gas-town/` directory is reserved for internal orchestration data.
All role prompts explicitly instruct agents **not** to read or write anything inside it.

## 2. Roles

Worker roles (polecat, witness, refinery, crew) are TOML files. Each declares its
name, description, `max_iterations`, tool list, and system prompt:

```toml
# roles/polecat.toml
name = "polecat"
description = "Autonomous worker. Completes exactly one assigned bead, then closes it."
max_iterations = 25
tools = ["read_file", "write_file", "patch_file", "list_files",
         "shell", "run_python", "bead", "analyze"]

[system]
text = """
You are a Polecat — an autonomous worker in a Gas Town rig.
You have ONE job: complete your assigned bead and close it.
...
"""
```

`roles/__init__.py` declares only the **Mayor** in Python (because its tools include
dynamically-built spawn tools), and derives `ROLE_NAMES` from TOML filenames:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from axio.agent import Agent
from axio.transport import DummyCompletionTransport

ROLES_DIR = Path(__file__).parent
ROLE_NAMES = [p.stem for p in sorted(ROLES_DIR.glob("*.toml"))]

MAYOR = Agent(system="...", transport=DummyCompletionTransport())
```

Worker roles are loaded at runtime via `load_agents()` once the shared toolbox
(including the open DB connection) is available.

### Mayor — chief-of-staff

The Mayor is the agent you talk to. It translates a task into a convoy:

1. Creates a `[CONVOY]` bead as the work-order unit.
2. Reads or analyses the domain (may use `analyze` or `list_files`).
3. Decomposes the task into small child beads — one per component.
4. Spawns polecats in parallel — one per bead, all in one response.
5. Optionally spawns Witness for a mid-convoy health check.
6. After all polecats finish, spawns Refinery to integrate the work.
7. Closes the convoy bead and reports to the user.

The Mayor never writes code itself. It only spawns workers.

### Polecat — ephemeral worker

A polecat has exactly one job: complete its assigned bead, then close it.

```
GUPP: if you find work, YOU RUN IT.
No announcement. No waiting. No idle state.
```

Lifecycle:

1. Receives bead assignment in its first message.
2. Marks the bead `in_progress` (done by `spawn_polecat` before the polecat starts).
3. Does the work (file tools, shell, run_python, analyze).
4. Closes the bead: `bead(action='close', id=<id>)`.
5. Session ends — done means gone.

If a polecat discovers unrelated work, it creates a new bead and continues.
It never fixes things outside its assigned bead.

### Witness — per-rig monitor

The Witness is a read-only monitor. It checks the bead store and workspace quality
via `bead(action='list')` and `analyze`, and produces a health report. It **does
not write code** and has no write tools.

Useful for long convoys (5+ polecats) as a mid-convoy checkpoint.

### Refinery — merge queue processor

The Refinery is the integration engineer. It is **not** a passive reviewer —
it actively integrates polecat work:

- Verifies that all pieces fit together (imports resolve, interfaces match).
- Runs tests and the linter.
- **Fixes integration issues** — broken imports, mismatched signatures, conflicts.
- Escalates to Mayor only when a fix requires re-doing a full bead.

The Refinery has full write tools. "No work can be lost" is its core rule.

### Crew — long-lived agents

Crew members are the agents you interact with for sustained, back-and-forth work —
design sessions, complex investigations, exploratory coding. Unlike polecats, they
are not ephemeral and not managed by the Witness. Each crew member gets an
`AutoCompactStore` context so long sessions survive context limits.

## 3. Spawn tools and TypedDict contexts

`swarm.py` defines spawn tools as top-level classes with typed `TypedDict` contexts —
not closures. Each tool carries all its runtime dependencies in the context dict:

```python
class SpawnPolecatContext(TypedDict):
    workspace: Path
    on_event: OnEventCallback
    transport: CompletionTransport
    role_models: dict[str, ModelSpec]
    proto: Agent          # polecat prototype loaded from TOML
    db: aiosqlite.Connection
    counters: dict[int, int]


class SpawnPolecat(ToolHandler[SpawnPolecatContext]):
    """Spawn a polecat worker to complete a specific bead."""
    bead_id: Annotated[int, Field(description="ID of the bead to work on")]
    topic: Annotated[str, Field(description="Short label, e.g. 'auth middleware'")]

    async def __call__(self, context: SpawnPolecatContext) -> str:
        db = context["db"]
        row = await get_bead(db, self.bead_id)
        if row is None:
            return f"Bead {self.bead_id} not found"
        bead_id, title, *_ = row
        await mark_in_progress(db, bead_id)

        context["counters"][self.bead_id] = context["counters"].get(self.bead_id, 0) + 1
        n = context["counters"][self.bead_id]
        agent_id = f"polecat#{n}:{self.topic}"

        polecat_transport = transport_for("polecat", context["transport"], context["role_models"])
        polecat = context["proto"].copy(transport=polecat_transport)
        polecat_ctx = AutoCompactStore(MemoryContextStore(), polecat_transport, keep_recent=6)
        stream = polecat.run_stream(
            f"Workspace: {context['workspace']}\n\n"
            f"Your assigned bead: [{bead_id}] {title}\n\n"
            f"Close it with bead(action='close', id={bead_id}).",
            polecat_ctx,
        )
        parts: list[str] = []
        async for event in stream:
            await context["on_event"](agent_id, event)
            if isinstance(event, TextDelta):
                parts.append(event.delta)
        return "".join(parts)
```

Key points:

- `spawn_polecat` is called multiple times in one Mayor response — they all run
  concurrently because Axio dispatches tool calls via `asyncio.gather()`.
- `topic` populates the status bar: **Polecat [auth middleware]**, **Polecat [data models]**,
  making parallel polecats identifiable at a glance.
- `mark_in_progress()` updates the SQLite row before the polecat starts, so Witness
  sees accurate status if it runs mid-convoy.
- The polecat prototype (`proto`) comes from `load_agents()` — it already has the
  full toolbox injected (bead, file tools, analyze).

## 4. The Analyze tool

Both Mayor and workers get an `analyze` tool that spawns ephemeral read-only analyst
subagents. The `AnalyzeContext` TypedDict carries the transport and callbacks:

```python
class AnalyzeContext(TypedDict):
    workspace: Path
    on_event: OnEventCallback
    transport: CompletionTransport
    role_models: dict[str, ModelSpec]
    guard_factory: GuardFactory | None
    counter: list[int]  # [0] holds mutable call count


ANALYST = Agent(
    system="You are a read-only analyst. Read files and produce a concise report. "
           "You must not create, modify, or delete any files.",
    transport=DummyCompletionTransport(),
)
```

Analysts are fast (small `max_iterations=10`, fast model) and safe to call in
parallel from multiple polecats simultaneously.

## 5. Toolbox and role loading

`build_toolbox()` creates the shared tool registry injected into worker roles:

```python
toolbox = build_toolbox(workspace, on_event, transport, role_models, db, guard_factory)
# toolbox == {
#   "read_file": Tool(...), "write_file": Tool(...), "patch_file": Tool(...),
#   "list_files": Tool(...), "shell": Tool(...), "run_python": Tool(...),
#   "bead": make_bead_tool(db, ...), "analyze": make_analyze_tool(...),
# }

roles = load_agents(ROLES_DIR, toolbox=toolbox)
# roles == {"polecat": ("Autonomous worker...", Agent(...)), "witness": ..., ...}
```

The Mayor gets its own separate tool set (spawn tools + bead + analyze + read tools)
because it does not use the standard worker toolbox.

## 6. GUPP in practice

GUPP is enforced through the system prompt. Every role includes a variant of:

```
The Propulsion Principle (GUPP)
--------------------------------
If you find assigned work, YOU RUN IT. No announcement, no confirmation, no waiting.
The assignment IS the authorisation. Gas Town is a steam engine — you are a piston.

Failure mode to avoid:
  Agent receives assignment → announces itself → waits for "ok go"
  Human is AFK → work sits idle → the whole convoy stalls.
```

The polecat prompt reinforces this with:

```
There is no step 5. There is no "wait for approval". There is no idle state.

If your assigned bead has nothing to implement:
- Note the reason: bead(action='note', id=<id>, notes='no-changes: <reason>')
- Close the bead:  bead(action='close', id=<id>)
Never leave without closing your bead.
```

This prevents the most common failure mode: a polecat that finishes work, says
"done!", and then sits idle waiting for acknowledgement — blocking the convoy.

## 7. Running it

```bash
cd examples/gas_town
uv sync
export NEBIUS_API_KEY=...

uv run python -m gas_town --workspace /tmp/my_project \
    "Build a Python rate limiter with token-bucket and sliding-window"
```

Or via the installed console script:

```bash
axio-gastown --workspace /tmp/my_project "Write an async task queue with priority levels"
```

Default model assignments in `__main__.py`:

```python
role_models: dict[str, ModelSpec] = {
    "default":  transport.models["MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.5"],
    "mayor":    transport.models["Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507"],
    "polecat":  transport.models["Qwen/Qwen3.5-397B-A17B"],
    "witness":  transport.models["openai/gpt-oss-120b"],
    "refinery": transport.models["openai/gpt-oss-120b"],
    # analyst runs many instances in parallel — use a fast model
    "analyst":  transport.models["deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2"],
}
```

After a run the workspace contains all produced artifacts alongside `AGENTS.md` (the
living project memory written and maintained by agents). The `.gas-town/` subdirectory
holds internal orchestration data including the bead SQLite database — agents are
instructed never to touch it.

Inspect the bead history with any SQLite tool:

```bash
sqlite3 workspace/.gas-town/beads.db "SELECT id, title, status, assignee FROM beads"
```

## Gas Town vs Agent Swarm

Both examples implement multi-agent coordination on top of Axio.
The key differences:

| | Agent Swarm | Gas Town |
|---|---|---|
| **Task tracking** | SQLite todo list (orchestrator) | SQLite bead store (all agents) |
| **Delegation** | `delegate(role, task)` — any role | `spawn_polecat(bead_id)` — per-bead |
| **Worker lifecycle** | Specialist returns result to orchestrator | Polecat closes its bead and disappears |
| **Oversight** | None | Witness monitors; Refinery integrates |
| **Crew** | No equivalent | Long-lived human-facing agents |
| **Work granularity** | One big task per specialist | One small bead per polecat |
| **Propulsion** | Orchestrator drives everything | GUPP: agent drives itself |
| **Workspace state** | Implicit (files only) | Explicit (bead store + files) |

Use **agent_swarm** when you want a straightforward team of specialists with minimal
overhead. Use **gas_town** when you want explicit work tracking, parallel polecat
swarms, integration review, and a workflow model that survives restarts.
