**Axio** (*Asynchronous eXtensible Intelligent Orchestration*) - a minimal but complete
foundation for building LLM-powered agents in Python.

Every integration point is a protocol - bring your own transport, context store,
tools, and permission guards.

## Why Axio?

The name is a backronym - each letter describes what the framework actually does:

**A - Asynchronous.**
The agent loop is built on `asyncio` end-to-end. Tool calls from a single
LLM response are dispatched concurrently via `asyncio.gather` so results
arrive in parallel, not sequentially. Every transport, tool, and context
store uses `async def` throughout - no thread pools or blocking I/O hidden
beneath the surface.

**X - eXtensible.**
Every integration point is a runtime-checkable `Protocol` or abstract base class.
You can swap the transport (OpenAI, Anthropic, any custom endpoint), the context
store (in-memory, SQLite, your own database), the permission guards, and the tools
without touching a single line of framework code. The plugin system - based on
Python entry points - lets separate packages register transports, tools, and
guards that are discovered automatically at runtime. Extensible is capitalised
because it is the core design decision from which everything else follows.

**I - Intelligent.**
The LLM drives the decision loop. Axio stays out of the way: it presents tools
to the model, faithfully delivers tool results back, and keeps iterating until the
model decides it is done. No hard-coded routing, no fixed decision trees - the
intelligence lives in the model, not the framework.

**O - Orchestration.**
Axio coordinates agents, tools, context, and permissions into a coherent execution
flow. Sub-agents can be spawned and composed via the built-in `subagent` tool;
context stores are shared across agents; permission guards form a composable
chain that gates every tool call. Complex multi-agent workflows emerge from
simple, well-defined primitives.

Extensible by design
: Every integration point is a runtime-checkable `Protocol` or ABC.
  Swap transports, context stores, tools, and guards without touching framework code.

Streaming by default
: All LLM I/O flows through typed `StreamEvent` values.
  No hidden buffering - you see every token, tool call, and result as it happens.

Tools are plain async functions
: Define parameters as function arguments, get JSON schema for free, implement the body for execution.
  Guards gate every tool call through a composable permission chain.

Multi-agent orchestration built-in
: Spawn sub-agents via the `subagent` tool, share context between agents,
  compose complex workflows - all without external dependencies.

### Architecture

    subgraph Core["axio - Core Framework"]
        B[Tool Handler<br/>async function]
        C[Permission Guard<br/>Protocol]
        D[StreamEvent<br/>Typed events]
    end

    subgraph Transport["Transport (pluggable)"]

    subgraph Context["Context Store (pluggable)"]

    subgraph LLM["LLM Provider"]

        L[Custom]
    end

    A -->|1. configures| B
    A -->|2. uses| C
    A -->|3. builds| D
    A -->|4. sends to| E
    A -->|5. stores in| H
    E -->|SSE| D
    D -->|tool call| B
    B -->|result| D
    D -->|text| J
    J -->|response| E
    E -->|reply| A
```

The agent loop:
1. You configure the agent with tools (async functions) and guards (permission chain)
2. User sends a message
3. Agent sends to transport → LLM
4. LLM responds with text or tool calls
5. Tools execute → results return → LLM generates final response
6. Events stream back to you (tokens, tool calls, results)

## How does Axio compare?

Here's how Axio compares to other popular Python agent frameworks:

| | Axio | pydantic-ai | LangChain / LangGraph | AutoGen |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Architecture** | Minimal core + protocols | Pydantic-native, validation-centric | Heavy abstraction layer | Multi-agent orchestration |
| **Streaming** | All events typed, full tool visibility | Text streaming works; tool calls and final answer can't stream simultaneously | Added later, inconsistent | Limited |
| **Tool definition** | Plain async function | Decorator + function signature → auto JSON schema | Functions + decorators | Class-based agents |
| **Transport** | Pluggable protocol; you bring the client | Built-in 20+ providers, trivial to swap | Built-in, harder to swap | Azure OpenAI focused |
| **Multi-agent** | Built-in (`subagent` tool, shared context stores) | Agent-as-tool pattern; not the primary focus | Via LangGraph | Native |
| **Learning curve** | Low - ~100 lines for an agent | Low for Pydantic/FastAPI users; moderate otherwise | Medium - many abstractions | High - complex configs |
| **Scope** | Agent loop + extensions | Agent + structured outputs; no RAG, no built-in memory | Full stack (RAG, chains, etc.) | Multi-agent scenarios |
| **API stability** | Stable | Beta (v0.x, breaking changes possible) | Stable | Stable |

### When to choose each

**Choose Axio if:**
- You want full control over every step of the agent cycle - no hidden magic, no framework opinions baked in
- You care about a lean dependency tree: every component is a separate PyPI package - install only what you need, fewer dependencies means fewer supply-chain attack risks; `aiohttp` is enough to wire up a transport for any HTTP-compatible LLM endpoint
- You prefer explicit protocols over decorator-driven conventions
- You need custom tooling and sandboxed execution - first-class from day one, with isolated Docker containers out of the box via [`axio-tools-docker`](guides/docker-sandbox.md)
- You're embedding an agent into a larger system and need to own the event loop, the streaming pipeline, and the permission model

**Choose pydantic-ai if:**
- You already use Pydantic/FastAPI and want the same patterns for agents
- Your agent must return strongly typed, validated structured outputs
- You need trivial provider swapping across 20+ LLM backends
- You're okay with beta-stage API stability

**Choose LangChain if:**
- You need RAG, text splitters, and other built-in utilities
- You want batteries-included with less wiring code
- You're prototyping quickly and can accept abstraction overhead

**Choose AutoGen if:**
- You're building complex multi-agent scenarios with conversation flows
- You need built-in support for human-in-the-loop
- You're okay with Azure OpenAI as the primary backend

**Actually - Axio also supports multi-agent:**
- Sub-agents via the built-in `subagent` tool
- Shared context stores for agent-to-agent communication
- Composable workflows without external dependencies

Axio's philosophy is thin abstraction over the prompt-completion loop,
not a full framework with opinions about how you should structure your application.
If that aligns with your needs - welcome.
