# Tool System

The executable logic is a plain `async def` handler. `Tool` is the glue that
declares that function as an agent tool. It attaches the name and execution
policy, and exposes the function signature and docstring to the model. A tool
call is different. It is one request from the model to invoke that Tool.

## Plain async function

<!-- name: test_write_file_handler -->
```python
from pathlib import Path
from axio import Tool


async def write_file(path: str, content: str) -> str:
    """Write content to a file at the given path."""
    Path(path).write_text(content)
    return f"Wrote {len(content)} bytes to {path}"


tool = Tool(name="write_file", handler=write_file)
```

Wrapping the handler in `Tool` makes it available to an Agent. The handler's
**docstring** becomes the description sent to the LLM. Function annotations
are converted to a JSON schema object automatically. No decorators or schema
registration are needed.

Use `Annotated` + `Field` to add descriptions, defaults, or numeric bounds:

<!-- name: test_write_file_with_field -->
```python
from typing import Annotated
from axio import Tool, Field


async def search(
    query: Annotated[str, Field(description="Search query")],
    limit: Annotated[int, Field(default=10, ge=1, le=100)] = 10,
) -> str:
    """Search the knowledge base."""
    return f"results for {query!r} (limit={limit})"


tool = Tool(name="search", handler=search)
result_default = search.__defaults__
assert result_default == (10,)
```

## Context injection

When a tool needs access to runtime state (a database connection, a sandbox
object, etc.), use `CONTEXT.get()` inside the function and pass the value
via `Tool(context=...)`:

<!-- name: test_tool_decorator -->

```python
import asyncio
from typing import Annotated
from axio import Tool, CONTEXT, Field


async def search(
    query: Annotated[str, Field(description="Search query")],
    limit: Annotated[int, Field(default=10, ge=1, le=100)] = 10,
) -> str:
    """Search a list of documents."""
    documents: list[str] = CONTEXT.get()
    results = [s for s in documents if query.lower() in s.lower()]
    return "\n".join(results[:limit]) or "no results"


documents = ["Axio is async", "Pydantic is great", "Axio uses protocols"]
t = Tool(name="search", handler=search, context=documents)

result = asyncio.run(t(query="axio"))
assert "Axio" in result
```

Nested helpers that cannot receive arguments can also call `CONTEXT.get()`:

<!-- name: test_tool_context_var -->

```python
import asyncio
from axio import Tool, CONTEXT


def helper() -> str:
    return str(CONTEXT.get())  # works even without an explicit argument


async def ping(msg: str) -> str:
    """Echo msg with context from ContextVar."""
    return f"{msg}:{helper()}"


t = Tool(name="ping", handler=ping, context="ctx-42")
assert asyncio.run(t(msg="hello")) == "hello:ctx-42"
```

## Tools, instructions, and selection

`Agent(tools=[...])` supplies a fixed base set. A tool provider can contribute
additional tools at each iteration, and a loaded {doc}`instruction <instructions>`
can add tools needed for its procedure. The agent collects these sets, attaches
its `tool_guards`, and passes the result to the {doc}`selector`.

`agent.get_tools()` returns the collected tools before selection. Only tools
selected for the current model request can run. Two different tool objects with
the same name are a configuration error; repeated references to the same object
are allowed. A provider entry-point name does not prefix the tool names it supplies.

(tool-providers)=
## Integrations that own tools and instructions

A filesystem integration can supply file tools and the project's conventions.
An MCP integration needs a live connection as well as the tools discovered on
that connection. A `ToolProvider` keeps each integration's tools, guidance, and
resource lifetime together. The transport still handles communication with the
language model; a tool provider supplies what the agent can use to work.

For local project tools, install `axio-tools-local` and use its provider directly:

<!-- name: test_concept_local_tool_provider -->
```python
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory

from axio import Agent, MemoryContextStore
from axio.plugins import open_tool_providers
from axio.testing import StubTransport, make_text_response
from axio_tools_local.provider import LocalOptions, LocalToolProvider


async def main() -> None:
    with TemporaryDirectory() as directory:
        root = Path(directory)
        (root / "AGENTS.md").write_text("Use the project's formatting conventions.")
        provider = LocalToolProvider()
        options = LocalOptions(
            cwd=root,
            roots=(root,),
            isolated=True,
            instruction_files=(root / "AGENTS.md",),
        )
        async with open_tool_providers([provider], config=options):
            agent = Agent(
                system="Help with this project.",
                transport=StubTransport([make_text_response("Ready.")]),
                providers=[provider],
            )
            provider.bind(agent)
            assert "read_file" in {tool.name for tool in agent.get_tools()}
            assert await agent.run("Hello", MemoryContextStore()) == "Ready."


asyncio.run(main())
```

`cwd` controls relative tool paths; `roots` describes independent project roots.
The explicit instruction file loads even in isolated mode. `bind(agent)` adds
the local provider's scoped instruction checks and prompt contribution. Bind
each copied agent separately. The stub avoids a model request; replace it with
your completion transport for real work.

Keep runs inside `open_tool_providers()`. It calls `init()` and registers cleanup
before initialization, then closes providers in reverse order even after a
partial startup, exception, or cancellation. An initialization exception propagates
after cleanup. Separate contexts let independent integrations fail separately.

An agent reads `all_tools` and `get_instructions()` at each iteration, so it sees
the provider's current catalog after reload. The application owns reload and
configuration. A copied list from `collect_tools()` is a snapshot: passing it as
`Agent(tools=...)` does not keep the provider's instructions or dynamic catalog.

For installed integrations, use `discover_tool_providers()` and select entries
from its catalog. Constructing an `Agent` does not discover or open integrations.
See {doc}`../guides/plugin-discovery` for registration and diagnostics and
{doc}`../guides/mcp-tools` for a provider backed by server sessions.

## Tool dataclass

Every handler function is wrapped in a `Tool` frozen dataclass:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class Tool[T]:
    name: str
    handler: Callable[..., Awaitable[Any]]
    description: str = ""  # defaults to handler.__doc__
    guards: tuple[PermissionGuard, ...] = ()
    concurrency: int | None = None
    context: T = ...  # default: empty mapping
    schema: MappingProxyType[str, Any] = ...  # default: built from the handler
    access: AccessDescriptor | None = None
    permission_identity: str = ""
```

`handler`
: An `async def` function.  A fresh call is made per invocation with
  validated kwargs.

`description`
: Defaults to `handler.__doc__`.  Pass an explicit string to override.

`guards`
: Guards run sequentially before the handler.  Each receives the `Tool` object
  and the raw kwargs, and either returns a (possibly modified) kwargs dict
  (allow) or raises `GuardError` (deny).

`concurrency`
: Limits parallel invocations of this tool via an `asyncio.Semaphore`.

`context`
: Arbitrary runtime state available via `CONTEXT.get()` inside the handler.
  Use this to inject a database connection, a sandbox object, or any other
  state the handler needs without touching global state.

`schema`
: The JSON Schema sent to the model. Built from the handler's annotations when
  you do not pass one. An explicit schema also replaces the fields used for
  validation and default injection. It becomes the filter that strips keys the
  model invented.

`access`
: Describes the operation's effects for instruction preflight and permission
  policy. For example, `file_access("write", "path")` declares the file written
  by a handler. The descriptor must report all effects without performing them.
  Missing declarations mean unknown effects. See {ref}`tool-effects`.

`permission_identity`
: Provider-supplied identity included in opaque-call approvals. Providers can
  distinguish differently configured instances of an otherwise identical tool,
  so permission for one server configuration does not authorize another.

### Input schema

<!-- not executed -->
```python
@property
def input_schema(self) -> JSONSchema:
    return copy.deepcopy(dict(self.schema))
```

Transports send this schema to the LLM so it knows how to call the tool.

### Returning content blocks

`handler` is typed `Callable[..., Awaitable[Any]]`, not `Awaitable[str]`. The
widening is load-bearing. A handler may return a list of content blocks:
`TextBlock`, `ImageBlock`, `AudioBlock`, `VideoBlock`. The agent puts them
straight into the `ToolResultBlock`, so a tool that reads a screenshot hands the
model pixels rather than a description of them. Anything else is stringified.
The agent additionally re-emits media from a tool result as `ImageOutput` /
`AudioOutput` / `VideoOutput` events so a harness can save it. See
{doc}`events`.

### Streaming tools

A tool whose output arrives over time - a shell command, a long build - can
stream it. Attach an async generator yielding `(key, text)` pairs to the handler
as `.stream`, and optionally a `format_stream_result(chunks)` for the finished
result:

<!-- not executed -->
```python
async def _shell_stream(command: str, timeout: int = 5):
    yield ("stdout", "compiling...\n")
    yield ("stderr", "[exit code: 0]")


shell.stream = _shell_stream
shell.format_stream_result = staticmethod(_format_records)
```

`Tool.supports_streaming` is then true. The agent dispatches through
`Tool.call_streaming()`, emitting a `ToolOutputDelta` per chunk while the tool
is still running. The model still sees one finished result, built by
`Tool.format_stream_result()` from the chunks and their timings. The default is
plain concatenation. `key` is the tool's own channel name. `axio-tools-local`
uses `stdout` and `stderr`.

Guards and validation run first either way. `call_streaming()` acquires the same
semaphore, validates the same kwargs, and calls the same guards before the first
chunk is produced.

## Execution flow

```{mermaid}
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent
    participant Tool
    participant Guard
    participant Handler

    Agent->>Tool: __call__(**kwargs)
    Tool->>Tool: Acquire semaphore (if set)
    Tool->>Tool: Inject defaults + validate types/bounds
    loop For each guard
        Tool->>Guard: check(tool, **kwargs)
        Guard-->>Tool: kwargs (or raise GuardError)
    end
    Tool->>Handler: handler(**kwargs)
    Handler-->>Tool: result string
    Tool-->>Agent: result
```

1. The agent calls `tool(**kwargs)` with the input the model provided.
2. If the tool has a concurrency limit, it acquires the semaphore.
3. Missing fields with defaults are injected. Provided fields are validated (type, Literal, bounds).
4. Each guard in the `guards` tuple is called sequentially with the fully materialised kwargs.
5. Guards return a (possibly modified) kwargs dict to allow, or raise `GuardError` to deny.
6. The handler is called with the materialised kwargs (stray keys stripped unless handler accepts `**kwargs`).
7. Any exception from the handler is wrapped in `HandlerError`.

## Exception hierarchy

```
AxioError
└── ToolError
    ├── GuardError    # Guard denied or crashed
    └── HandlerError  # Handler raised during execution
```

The agent catches both and wraps the error message in a `ToolResultBlock`
with `is_error=True`, so the model can see what went wrong and retry or
adjust its approach.

## ToolSelector

The `ToolSelector` protocol allows a component to filter or rank the full set
of available tools before each LLM call.

<!--
name: test_tool_selector_protocol
```python
from axio import PermissionGuard

ToolName = str
```
-->
<!-- name: test_tool_selector_protocol -->
```python
from collections.abc import Iterable
from typing import Any, Protocol, runtime_checkable
from axio.messages import Message
from axio import Tool


@runtime_checkable
class ToolSelector(Protocol):
    async def select(
        self,
        messages: Iterable[Message],
        tools: Iterable[Tool[Any]],
    ) -> Iterable[Tool[Any]]: ...
```

A selector is useful when you have a large tool catalogue and want to avoid
sending every tool's schema to the model on every turn. Embeddings or keyword
matching can pick only the relevant tools.

Pass a `ToolSelector` implementation directly to `Agent(selector=...)`.
